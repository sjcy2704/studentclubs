We typically host BBQs on a Friday on the Barr Smith lawns at the start of every term, it doesn\'t get much better than this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year we coordinate and fund an Industry Night with the rest of the Societies of ECMS.

And how did it start?</p><p>In the 1950s, there was an influx of Asian students into Australian capital cities. Soon, students from the various cities started to meet through organised Bible camps. During this period, OCF Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney were formed. The fellowship in Adelaide was then called Asian Fellowship. Then, it was in 1959 at their first conference at Phillip Island and after much prayer and discussion, OCF Australia was born.</p><p>Since 1959, OCF has grown in its ministry with 24 OCF centres currently established in university campuses in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, Western Australia, and the ACT.</p><p>OCF is bible believing and committed to sharing the gospel. OCF is not a church, but rather as an arm of it. We seek to complement the local churches’ ministries, in cultivating Christian attributes in every OCF-er. OCF is inter-denominational and we’re a student-led and student-run organisation. That makes us quite unique<img src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ff6/2/16/1f609.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\"></p><p>OCF has two aims, first in missions and evangelism and second in teaching and training. We aim for every OCF-er to see his or her own campus and home country as mission fields. To be trained in evangelism and missions, to actively reach out to the lost, especially university mates, flatmates, and family, to participate in missions work through giving, going, sending and praying.
